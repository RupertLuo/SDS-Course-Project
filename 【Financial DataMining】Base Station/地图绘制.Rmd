## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(leaflet)
data=read.csv("~/Desktop/金大final/2000.csv",sep=';',fileEncoding = 'UTF-8',header = TRUE)
pal <- colorFactor(c("navy", "red","#B9D3EE","#FFFAFA","#FFFF00","#00FF7F","#4682B4","#D2B486","#FFA54F","#FFE1FF","#7D26CD","#FF82AB","#AEEEEE","#FA8072","#C0FF3E","#FFB6C1","#EEDD82","#EE00EE","#4D4D4D","#CD661D"), domain = data$modularity_class)
my_map=leaflet()%>%
  addTiles()
pop_radius=rep(10,2923)
shanghai_map=my_map%>%
  #addCircles(data = data,lng = ~lng,lat = ~lat,weight = 3,popup = ~Id,radius = ~pop_radius)%>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    data = data,lng = ~lng,lat = ~lat,weight = 3,popup = ~Id,radius = ~pop_radius,
    color = ~pal(modularity_class),
    stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.5)

shanghai_map

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
